	 			 Would I - and people in our contemporary <a  href="page5.html">society</a> be able to wake up in the morning  without hearing an <a class="link2" href="page6.html" > alarm </a> from their cellphones?  Are we able to get to where we need to be without having entered a car in the process,using our cellphones to visually or verbally guide our <a  href="page7.html"> directions </a>?
