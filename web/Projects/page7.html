	 	<p >This task would be considered an easy task, or even common sense to a <a class="link7"  href="page10.html"> millennial </a> or someone born in the latter years of the 20th century. Technology has changed the way <a  href="page1.html"> children </a> play as well. Before technological devices could be found in almost every household, children would play with toys and read <a  href="page2.html"> physical </a> books. Now, when bored, children will watch movies, check their social media accounts, or play video games together. Even when reading books, some children and adults prefer to read through their tablets or cellphones. </p>
